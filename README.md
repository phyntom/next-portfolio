# Introduction

## Getting started

Welcome to my portfolio! I've crafted this site using Next.js for a fast, responsive experience, Tailwind CSS for sleek
styling, and Framer Motion for fluid animations. As a software engineer, I believe a portfolio is crucial to showcase my
expertise, experience, and passion for crafting exceptional digital experiences. Here, you'll find a collection of my
projects that highlight my skills and creativity. Explore and feel free to reach out for collaboration or opportunities!

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Microsoft Azure. It was deployed using Docker (https://www.docker.com/) container from as it can
be seen from Dockerfile and I used the simplest way to deploy dockerized app in Azure using AppService. The domain was
purchased on [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) then configured in Azure custom domains settings.
