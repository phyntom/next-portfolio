# Introduction

Portfolio web project create using Next.js 14

## Getting started

Welcome to my portfolio! I've crafted this site using Next.js for a fast, responsive experience, Tailwind CSS for sleek
styling, and Framer Motion for fluid animations. As a software engineer, I believe a portfolio is crucial to showcase my
expertise, experience, and passion for crafting exceptional digital experiences. Here, you'll find a collection of my
projects that highlight my skills and creativity. Explore and feel free to reach out for collaboration or opportunities!
